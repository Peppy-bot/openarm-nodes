//! The real arm's control: a single task that owns the motors and runs an MIT
//! control loop following the backbone's governed setpoint. The bimanual coordination
//! backbone (openarm_backbone) owns all trajectory generation, stream following, and
//! collision governing, and streams the resolved (q_des, dq_des) per arm; this
//! loop adds only the realtime feedforward (gravity/Coriolis/friction the backbone
//! cannot compute remotely) and a final clamp to the joint limits, then commands
//! the motors. There is no mode state machine and no streaming logic here.
//!
//! On shutdown the loop disables the motors and lets the arm go limp. It does not
//! park to a pose: a collision-aware return-to-home is the backbone's job (it sees both
//! arms), and a local straight-line joint path would be collision-blind and could
//! command the two arms into each other.
