//! The per-tick travel each governed DOF may take: the arm joint speed cap for

//!
//! The chase upstream already limits every DOF, so on a healthy tick this is
//! inert. It is here because the floor scan sizes its probe count from the same
//! bound: distance is not monotone along a segment, so a step past the bound
//! under-resolves the scan and can step over a pocket and miss a breach.
//! Clamping keeps that precondition true by construction, and keeps the robot
//! under control when something upstream is wrong.
