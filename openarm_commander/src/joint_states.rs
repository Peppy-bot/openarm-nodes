// Live arm joint state for the UI. Observes each side's backbone<->arm pairing
// and reports the follower's measured positions to the owner. The observer slot
// fixes the side (an observed pairing delivers only its one follower), so there
// is no id demux. It runs continuously and works in every deployment, including
// ones where another node commands; the owner decides how to fold each
// measurement into the target.
